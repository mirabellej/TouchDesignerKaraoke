# TouchDesignerKaraoke
This is a network for several video files and songs to be used as a karaoke machine. 

To Use: 

There are 17 songs currently in the network. Replace the text inside each song's text dat (inside the lyrics selection comp) with the lyrics you want to use. Replace the path to the video files with the path to the folder of the videos or graphics you want to use. 

You can, of course, delete videos or lyrics as you please! The sample uses videos and lyrics for the performance THIS MUSIC IS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO HUMANITY which shows at Sort / Hvid Theatre November 4th - 6th 2021. 

To navigate through the karaoke clips press 1 to go forward, 2 to go backward, and 3 to return to the beginning. Big thanks to Biliam Tschepe for the "lyric video" tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCONptu0J1PCrW9YfBtSdqjA
